# Sample Receipt Placeholder

This file is a placeholder for sample receipt images used in E2E tests.

To add a sample receipt for OCR testing:
1. Place a receipt image file (JPG, PNG, HEIC) in this directory
2. Name it `sample-receipt.jpg` or `sample-receipt.png`
3. Update test files that use `SAMPLE_RECEIPT_PATH` constant

Note: Actual receipt images are gitignored to avoid committing sensitive data.
For testing without OCR API calls, use `OCR_PROVIDER=dummy` in backend/.env
